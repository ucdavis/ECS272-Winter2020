# Final Project

For the final project, you will implement a system or technique from a published paper. We have curated more than a dozen papers for you to pick one in the Google Doc [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16rtpJ0q1DjUTXBih1Me7YhXmEuCw6R4Qy8NhCyEsP30/edit?usp=sharing). Note that the same paper cannot be chosen by more than two teams. Most of these systems come with demo videos which you can use to help learn about system interactions and functionality. 

You are expected to find your own dataset(s). The papers usually contain several examples, which you may use. But we also encourage you to find other datasets to see how well they work with the implemented system.

Your objective for this project is to recreate the presented system (or technique) as close as possible. For each paper, we list some of the primary items of highest importance (system features, visualizations, algorithms, functionality, interactions, etc.), as well as optional tasks that can merit extra credit (for example, a 2nd or 3rd dataset can be imported and tested for all papers). However, you should strive to make your system as close to the paper-version (or better!) as possible. This includes things like color palette choices, menu layouts and icons, font stylings, interactions, etc. For some papers that are more technique-oriented (as opposed to published systems), such as NodeTrix, you can implement your own UI. You will still have to carefully read through the paper to understand the necessary technique features and how to implement them.

At the end of the quarter, you will present your system to the class! So strive to do good work and create a nice looking system.


Note that some of these papers have implementations on the web. You should do your own work and development. We will check submitted systems for plagiarism.

## Proposal

Your proposal will describe what you will implement from the paper. First, start by having a short summary of the paper. Discuss the benefits of technique/visualization used in the paper. Second, describe what aspects of the paper you will implement in your version of the system. If there is something in the paper that you will not implement, explain why. If your selected paper is more technique-oriented, then describe the UI system you will implement to take advantage of the technique(s). You can also choose to introduce a new visualization or feature, and describe how this inclusion will improve the selected paper. Next, describe the dataset(s) you will use and what you expect to find/see. Lastly, provide a timeline on how you would split the work between the three project members and what you expect to get done by the milestone.

## Milestone

The milestone will gauge that you are progressing appropriately 
on the project. Submit your current source codes and/or interim report along with a short milestone.txt noting your current progress.


## Final Report

Since your work is based on a published paper, your report should be more about what you did and how you evaluate your implementation and resulting visualizations. Some of the things to include in the report are, but not limited to:

* Clearly state your goal in this project and your approach
* Write up your experience in coding the system. What was difficult / easy / unexpected?
* Did the paper provide all the information needed for implementation? Is everything in the paper reproducible? Why or why not?
* Describe if the system differs any from the paper version (e.g., different implementation choices, a simplified design, extended capabilities, etc.) and why
* Describe the dataset you picked. Compare it to the one(s) presented in the paper.
* Present your case study and/or analysis results
* Discuss the strengths and limitations of your implementation, and ways of further improving the work (beyond what is presented in the paper)
