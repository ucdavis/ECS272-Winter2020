          This image is a flow diagram of refugees who saught asylum in European countries in 2012 and 2014. 
          It is a static visualization that tells the viewer how many refugees there were, which country they 
          were fleeing from, which European country they were fleeing to, and the proportion of refugees that 
          were rejected or accepted by their destination.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe that the image is a good visualization. The image presents its information in ways that make it quick and 
          easy to understand. It uses distinctive coloring that lets you identify which parts of the diagram convey different 
          information at a glance. The branches in the flow diagram and their relative sizes to each other also give 
          the viewer a quick general understanding of how the refugees were divided up and what proportion of them were successful 
          in finding asylum.
