        <p>1. What is being shown?</p>
        This visualization shows how the congressmen got to the current position.(Mainly their education backgrounds, career paths etc.)
        <p>2. Is the visualization interactive or static? If interactive, how can it be interacted with?</p>
        It's interactive(Please check out the original site for more). It has a drop down list where you could select one specific individual to see his/her path.
        <p>3. What are some of the design choices and visualization techniques used?</p>
        It uses two different colors to mark the people from Democratic or Republican party respectively, and it splits the chart into different phases to distinguish different stages of their paths.
        <p>4. What, in your opinion, is the rationale behind the design choices?</p>
        Colors for different group of people, lines to simulate the life paths and directions, etc.
        <p>5. Do you think this is a good visualization? Give a short critique on why or why not. </p>
        Yes. From the chart we can easily see the different path patterns, the similarity and differences among the current congressmen. Also we can check out one single congressman to see his/her path.
